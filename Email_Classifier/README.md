# Email Classification App

This project is a **Streamlit** web application that predicts whether a given email is **Spam** or **Ham** using a machine learning model. The app provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input the text of an email and receive a prediction.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive design to classify emails as Spam or Ham.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Immediate feedback on the email classification based on the text input.
- **Interactive**: Allows users to experiment with different email texts and observe the classification results.

## Demo

You can access the live app here: [Email Classification App](https://email-classifier-model.onrender.com/)

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Users input the text of an email into the provided text area.
2. **Prediction**: The app processes the input through a pre-trained machine learning model.
3. **Output**: The app displays the classification result, indicating whether the email is Spam or Ham.

## Installation

If you want to run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/venkyeswar/DataScience_Projects.git
