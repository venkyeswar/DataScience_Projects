# Titanic Survival Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit** web application that predicts the survival probability of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features. The machine learning model was built using various libraries and technologies, providing a robust and reliable prediction.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and interactive design for inputting passenger details and predicting survival probability.
- **Custom-Built Model**: The machine learning model was independently developed using a combination of libraries and techniques.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Get instant feedback on the likelihood of survival based on passenger attributes.

## Demo

You can access the live app here: [Titanic Survival Prediction App](https://titanic-survival-prediction-5nst.onrender.com/)

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Users input passenger details such as age, sex, class, etc.
2. **Prediction**: The app processes these inputs through a custom-built machine learning model.
3. **Output**: The app displays the probability of survival for the given passenger details.

## Installation

If you want to run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venkyeswar/DataScience_Projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd titanic_survival_predictor
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Model Details

The model used for predicting survival was built using a combination of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms. Detailed information about the model and the process can be found in the `model_building.ipynb` file in the repository.
