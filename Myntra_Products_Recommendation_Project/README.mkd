# Product Recommendation System

This  is a **Product Recommendation System** designed to suggest similar products based on a given product name. The system uses two methods for recommendation:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: Based on numerical product features like price, rating, and discount.
2. **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**: Based on textual features such as the product name.

## Features

- **Input**: Users can enter a product name.
- **Output**: The system returns a list of products that are similar to the input product.
- The recommendations are based on:
  - **Cosine Similarity** between product attributes.
  - **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity** for product name comparison.

## Methods

1. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - This method calculates the similarity between products using their numerical features, such as price, rating, and discount. 
   - It suggests products that are most similar based on these attributes.

2. **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**:
   - This method focuses on textual data (e.g., product names). 
   - The product names are vectorized using the TF-IDF technique, and cosine similarity is calculated to find the most similar products based on name.

## Workflow

1. **Dataset**:
   - The system loads a dataset containing product information, including attributes like `name`, `price`, `rating`, and `discount`.
   
2. **Similarity Computation**:
   - For numerical features, cosine similarity is computed between product attributes.
   - For textual features, TF-IDF is applied to the product names, followed by cosine similarity to find similar products.

3. **Product Recommendations**:
   - The system provides recommendations based on the input product name by comparing it to other products in the dataset using either method (cosine similarity or TF-IDF).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Download the project and install the necessary dependencies.

2. **Provide Product Name**:
   - Input a product name into the system to receive recommendations of similar products.

3. **View Recommendations**:
   - The system will output a list of similar products, including attributes like name, price, rating, and discount.

## Example

For an input product like `"Men Solid Oversized Cotton"`, the system will suggest similar products with details such as:

- **Product Name**
- **Price**
- **Rating**
- **Discount**

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporating more product features such as brand or category for more accurate recommendations.
- Optimizing the system to handle large datasets more efficiently.
- Developing a web interface using technologies like Flask or Streamlit for easier interaction.
