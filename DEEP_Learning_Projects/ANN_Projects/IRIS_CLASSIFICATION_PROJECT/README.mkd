# Iris Classification Using ANN

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the Iris dataset. The model has achieved high accuracy in predicting the species of Iris flowers based on their features.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The Iris dataset is used, which consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Each sample has four features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width

- **Model**: An ANN is built and trained on the dataset. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to select the optimal number of layers and neurons in each layer.

## Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy**: 98%
- **Test Accuracy**: 100%

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for building the model and the web application.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for deploying the model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks (if applicable).
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the ANN.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations (if applicable).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venkyeswar/DataScience_Projects.git
   cd DEEP_Learning_Projects/ANN_Projects/IRIS_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
